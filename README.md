# Credit-Risk-Analysis-Classification-and-Customer-Segmentation
A credit risk data set having a dependent variable "defaulters" was used to predict the defaulters by using a classification algorithm "RandomForest" and taking all evaluation metrics possible. Here Recall would be considered to find out the defaulters even if they are less in number but can impact a large loss. After that the customers were segmented by using K-means clustering algorithm with age, income, debt-income ratio and employment in years to understand the risk associated in terms of giving the loan to different age groups.
